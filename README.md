☑️ Mastering ReactJS/Vite with a Todo List App ☑️

Welcome to my ReactJS/Vite work! 

🚀 In this project, I've put theory into practice and created an interactive and dynamic Todo List application.

📚 What I've Applied:

useState/useEffect: I've mastered the useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects in my application.

Props: I've dived into the concept of props to pass data and functionality between components.

Componentization: I've learned how to create modular and reusable components, enhancing the structure and maintainability of my project.

Function Sharing: I've honed my skills in importing and exporting functions to streamline my codebase.

This project has been a pivotal journey, allowing me to solidify my understanding of ReactJS/Vite and create a fully functional Todo List.
